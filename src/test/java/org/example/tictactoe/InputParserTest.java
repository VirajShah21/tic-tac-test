    * TODO - Write some tests in this file. You should test the InputParser class. Please test the following behaviors
    *  1. When a user inputs a valid coordinate string (in the form 2,1 where 2 is the row and 1 is the column)
    *     the InputParser returns a CellSelection with what they entered
    *  2. If the user tries to use a coordinate with an out of bounds row or column, the InputParser throws an InputMoveException
    *  3. If the user tries to use a coordinate that has too many components, the InputParser throws an InputMoveException
    *  4. If the user tries to use a coordinate with invalid integer numbers, the InputParser throws an InputMoveException
    *  5. If the user tries to choose a coordinate in a square that is already filled with another value, the InputParser
    *     throws an InputMoveException
